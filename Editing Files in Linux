Editing Files
Linux, like other operating systems, allows file editing for numerous purposes, whether you need to configure some system functionality or writing scripts.
Thereâ€™s a variety of text editors available in Linux by default, these include: nano, vi/vim, emacs, and gedit.
Each of these has its own learning curve and set of commands.

For instance, nano is a basic text editor, which is easy to use and perfect for simple text file editing.
Vi/vim, on the other hand, is more advanced and offers a wide range of features and commands.
