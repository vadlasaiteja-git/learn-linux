How to understand the difference between hard and symbolic links in Linux?

Introduction
Linux file systems offer more than just simple data containers - they also include special entities called file links. 
These links provide a way to access the same file content through different names or locations, offering flexibility and efficiency in file management. 

What are File Links?
A file link is a reference to the actual file data stored in the file system. 
When you create a file, the operating system assigns a unique identifier called an inode to that file. 
The inode contains information about the file, such as its permissions, ownership, and the physical location of the file data on the storage device.

File links come in two main types:

Hard Links: A hard link is a direct reference to the inode of the file. When you create a hard link, you're essentially creating an additional name for the same file data, 
without duplicating the actual file content.
Symbolic (Soft) Links: A symbolic link, also known as a symlink, is a special type of file that contains a reference to another file or directory. 
Unlike hard links, symbolic links store the path to the target file or directory, rather than a direct reference to the inode.

Practical Applications of File Links
File links in Linux have several practical applications:

Space Optimization: Hard links allow you to create multiple references to the same file data, without consuming additional storage space. This can be useful for organizing files in different locations without duplicating the content.
Backup and Restoration: When you back up a file system, hard links are preserved, ensuring that the backup accurately reflects the original file structure and relationships.
Symbolic Links for Convenience: Symbolic links can be used to create shortcuts or aliases to files or directories, making it easier to access frequently used resources from different locations.
Compatibility and Versioning: Symbolic links can be used to maintain compatibility between different versions of software or libraries, by providing a consistent interface for accessing the appropriate files.


Exploring File Links in Action
Let's explore some examples of working with file links in Linux:

## Create a new file
touch file1.txt

## Create a hard link to file1.txt
ln file1.txt file2.txt

## Create a symbolic link to file1.txt
ln -s file1.txt symlink.txt

## Observe the file types and inode numbers
ls -li

The output of the ls -li command will show the inode numbers and file types for the original file, the hard link, and the symbolic link.


In this example, file1.txt and file2.txt share the same inode, indicating they are hard links to the same file data. symlink.txt is a symbolic link that points to file1.txt.
