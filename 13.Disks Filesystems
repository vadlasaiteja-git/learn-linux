Linux Disks Filesystems
Linux uses a variety of filesystems to allow us to store and retrieve data from the hardware of a computer system such as disks. The filesystem defines how data is organized, stored, and retrieved on these storage devices. Examples of popular Linux filesystems include EXT4, FAT32, NTFS, and Btrfs.

Each filesystem has its own advantages, disadvantages, and use cases. For example, EXT4 is typically used for Linux system volumes due to its robustness and compatibility with Linux, while FAT32 may be used for removable media like USB drives for its compatibility with almost all operating systems

Here’s an example of how to display the type of filesystems of your mounted devices with the “df” command in Linux:

df -T
The output shows the names of your disks, their filesystem types, and other additional information such as total space, used space, and available space on the disks.

Inodes
In a Linux filesystem, an inode (index node) is a core concept that represents a filesystem object such as a file or a directory. More specifically, an inode is a data structure that stores critical information about a file except its name and actual data. This information includes the file’s size, owner, access permissions, access times, and more.

Every file or directory in a Linux filesystem has a unique inode, and each inode is identified by an inode number within its own filesystem. This inode number provides a way of tracking each file, acting as a unique identifier for the Linux operating system.

Whenever a file is created in Linux, it is automatically assigned an inode that stores its metadata. The structure and storage of inodes are handled by the filesystem, which means the kind and amount of metadata in an inode can differ between filesystems.

Although you would not interact with inodes directly in everyday usage, understanding inodes can be very helpful when dealing with advanced file operations, such as creating links or recovering deleted files.

# Retrieve the inode of a file
ls -i filename

Filesystems
Linux operating system provides multiple ways to handle the data storage through the concept of filesystems under disks. Filesystems, in essence, is the way how files are stored and organized on the storage disk. It’s a critical component of the system as it ensures the integrity, reliability and efficient access to the data.

A disk installed in a Linux system can be divided into multiple partitions, each with its own filesystem. Linux supports various types of filesystems, such as EXT4, XFS, BTRFS, etc. Each one of them has their own advantages regarding performance, data integrity and recovery options.

Configuration of these filesystems relies on a defined hierarchical structure. All the files and directories start from the root directory, presented by ’/’.

Understanding the concept and management of filesystems is key for the successful administration of Linux systems, as it involves routine tasks like mounting/unmounting drives, checking disk space, managing file permissions, and repairing corrupted filesystems.

Code snippet to display the file system in Linux:

df -T
This command will display the type of filesystem, along with the disk usage status.
