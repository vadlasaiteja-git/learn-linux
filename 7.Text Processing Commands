Text processing in Linux involves manipulating text data to extract meaningful information or to transform it into a desired output. 
This is particularly useful because in Linux, everything is treated as a file, including text data. 
By mastering Linux text processing commands, you can complete tasks more efficiently, saving time and effort in your daily workflow.

These commands are especially useful in several scenarios, such as when working with log files during debugging, in CI/CD pipelines, or when handling large amounts of data.

A Brief Overview Of STDIN, STDOUT & STDERR

Standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), and standard error (stderr) are the three standard streams that allow users to interact with commands and scripts in Linux. 
Understanding how to use these streams is crucial for efficiently working with Linux commands and scripts. 
Without a clear understanding of stdin, stdout, and stderr, it can be challenging to effectively manage command output.
