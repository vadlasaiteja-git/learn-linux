Text processing in Linux involves manipulating text data to extract meaningful information or to transform it into a desired output. 
This is particularly useful because in Linux, everything is treated as a file, including text data. 
By mastering Linux text processing commands, you can complete tasks more efficiently, saving time and effort in your daily workflow.

These commands are especially useful in several scenarios, such as when working with log files during debugging, in CI/CD pipelines, or when handling large amounts of data.
