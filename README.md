## What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for a wide range of operating systems. It was developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Since then it has evolved into one of the most powerful OS available. By open-source we mean that users can view, modify, and distribute the source code freely, which is unlike other common OS like Windows and macOS.

The Linux model is built with an emphasis on collaboration, making it easier for contributors worldwide to contribute to its improvement. Although you may not have interacted with the OS directly, you might have interacted with devices that are powered by Linux, a good example of this is Android devices.
