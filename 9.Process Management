Process Management
Process management is integral part of any operating system and Linux is no different. Every program running on Linux, be it an application or a system operation, is treated as a process. These processes perform different tasks but work together to provide a seamless operating experience.

In Linux, users can interact and manage these processes by using different commands for various process management tasks such as viewing the currently running processes, killing processes, changing the priority of a process, and so on. Understanding these commands and how to use them effectively is essential to Linux process management.

The ps command for example, provides information about the currently running processes:

>_ps aux
This will list out all the currently running processes with information such as the process ID, the user running that process, the CPU and memory it’s consuming, the command that started the process, and more.

top is another common command. It provides a live, updating view of the current state of the system including processes:

top

Yet another powerful tool is kill, which can send specific signals to processes. For example, you can gracefully stop a process with SIGTERM (15) or forcefully stop one with SIGKILL (9):

kill -SIGTERM pid
kill -SIGKILL pid

Managing bg (background) and fg (foreground) Processes
In Linux environment, a process can be run in either the foreground (fg) or the background (bg). The foreground process takes input directly from the user, displaying output and errors to the user’s terminal. On the other hand, a background process runs independently of the user’s actions, freeing up the terminal for other tasks.

Typically, a process starts in the foreground. However, you can send it to the background by appending an ampersand (&) to the command or by using the bg command. Conversely, the fg command brings a background process to the foreground.

Here’s how you can send a running process to background:

command &

Or if a process is already running:

CTRL + Z       # This will pause the process
bg             # This resumes the paused process in the background
And to bring it back to the foreground:

fg
These commands, bg and fg are part of job control in Unix-like operating systems, which lets you manage multiple tasks simultaneously from a single terminal.
