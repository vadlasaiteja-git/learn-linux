Creating a Sample Directory Structure
cd ~/project
mkdir -p test_dir/{subdir1,subdir2}
echo "This is file 1" > test_dir/file1.txt
echo "This is file 2" > test_dir/file2.txt
echo "This is in subdir1" > test_dir/subdir1/subfile1.txt
echo "This is in subdir2" > test_dir/subdir2/subfile2.txt

Now, let's verify the structure we've created:
tree test_dir
