How to understand the difference between hard and symbolic links in Linux?

Introduction
Linux file systems offer more than just simple data containers - they also include special entities called file links. 
These links provide a way to access the same file content through different names or locations, offering flexibility and efficiency in file management. 

What are File Links?
A file link is a reference to the actual file data stored in the file system. 
When you create a file, the operating system assigns a unique identifier called an inode to that file. 
The inode contains information about the file, such as its permissions, ownership, and the physical location of the file data on the storage device.

File links come in two main types:

Hard Links: A hard link is a direct reference to the inode of the file. When you create a hard link, you're essentially creating an additional name for the same file data, 
without duplicating the actual file content.
Symbolic (Soft) Links: A symbolic link, also known as a symlink, is a special type of file that contains a reference to another file or directory. 
Unlike hard links, symbolic links store the path to the target file or directory, rather than a direct reference to the inode.
