1. What is a Path Variable?
A path variable is an environment variable that stores directories where the system looks for executable files.
The most important path variable is $PATH.

Check your PATH variable:
echo $PATH

Each directory in $PATH is separated by a colon (:).

When you type a command (e.g., ls or python), the shell searches these directories in order and executes the first matching file.
