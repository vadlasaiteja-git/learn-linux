User Management
Linux operating system offers a structured user management system, allowing multiple users to interact with the same system in an isolated manner. This includes defining user roles, assigning permissions, groups, ownership and other related aspects, which are crucial tasks for Linux administrators.

For smoother and controlled operation, user management in Linux includes tasks such as creating, deleting, modifying users and groups. It also involves assigning permissions and ownership of files and directories to users/groups.

The entire concept of user management circles around providing proper accessibility, and maintaining the security of the Linux operating system. Other commands such as passwd for password management or su for switching users further emphasize the depth and importance of user management in Linux.

Creating a new user
To create a new user account on our Linux system we can use the useradd utility; its syntax is the following:

useradd [options] LOGIN

Where LOGIN is the login name to be created. Suppose we want to create a new account for the “newuser” user; we would run:

$ sudo useradd newuser
The command above will create the “newuser” account on the system; additionally an home directory will be created for the user, since, as we can see in the table above, the CREATE_HOME option is set to yes by default. It is possible to to request the creation of a home directory for the new user explicitly by using the -m (short for --create-home) option of the useradd command.
If we instead we want to avoid the creation of said directory we should use the -M option, which is the short for --no-create-home.
After the creation of a user, the recommended way to set its password is to use the passwd utility, remember this, is an important step!

Specifying a login shell
Another common thing we may want to specify when creating a new user, is its login shell: we can do it by using the -s option (--shell) and passing the path of the shell binary as argument. If this option is not provided explicitly, the shell specified by the $SHELL variable will be used (on Fedora it is /bin/bash). For instance, to explicitly declare the login shell of a new user, we would run:

$ sudo useradd -s /bin/bash newuser

Manually specify the user UID
When a new user is created, by default, the first available uid greater or equal to that specified by the UID_MIN option in the /etc/login.defs file, greater than the one of any other user and smaller or equal to the one specified with the UID_MAX option, is assigned to him. If we want to manually specify an uid, we should use the -u (--uid) option and provide the uid value we want to use as its argument (it must be a non-negative value). To create a user with an uid of 1005 assigned manually, we would run:

$ sudo useradd -u 1005 newuser
