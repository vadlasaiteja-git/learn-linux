Understanding the Basic cp Command
The cp command is fundamental for duplicating files in Linux.

cp ~/project/important_report.txt ~/project/important_report_backup.txt

This command creates a copy of important_report.txt named important_report_backup.txt in the same directory. Here's what each part of the command means:

cp: This is the command for copying files.
~/project/important_report.txt: This is the source file we want to copy. The ~ symbol represents your home directory.
~/project/important_report_backup.txt: This is the destination file. We're creating a new file with "_backup" added to the name.
