The process of reviewing a server in Linux involves assessing the server’s performance, security, and configuration to identify areas of improvement or any potential issues. The scope of the review can include checking security enhancements, examining log files, reviewing user accounts, analyzing the server’s network configuration, and checking its software versions.

Linux, known for its stability and security, has become a staple on the back-end of many networks and servers worldwide. Depending on the distribution you are using, Linux offers multiple tools and commands to perform comprehensive server reviews.

# A command often used for showing memory information
free -m

# A command for showing disk usage
df -h

# A command for showing CPU load
uptime

It is a critical task for System Administrators and DevOps professionals to routinely conduct server reviews to ensure the server’s optimal performance, security, and reliability.

Uptime Load
When managing a Linux server, one critical metric deserving close scrutiny is the “uptime”. The uptime command in Linux gives information about how long the system has been running without shutting down or restarting, and the system load average.

The system load average is an important indicator that illustrates the amount of computational work that a computer system performs. It’s a reflection of how many processes are waiting in line to get CPU time. The system load average is typically shown for 1, 5, and 15 minutes durations.

By consistently analyzing the uptime and load on a Linux server, administrators can identify system usage patterns, diagnose possible performance issues, and determine an efficient capacity planning strategy. If a server has a high load average, it may suggest that the system resources are not sufficient or are misconfigured, leading to possible slow performance or system unresponsiveness.

Here is an example of the uptime command and its output:

$ uptime
 10:58:35 up 2 days, 20 min,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
In the output above, “2 days, 20 min” tells us how long the system has been up, while “0.00, 0.01, 0.05” shows the system’s load average over the last one, five, and fifteen minutes, respectively.


Auth Logs
When dealing with a Linux server and its maintenance, one of the most critical components to regularly review is the auth logs. These logs, usually located in /var/log/auth.log (for Debian-based distributions) or /var/log/secure (for Red Hat and CentOS), record all authentication-related events and activities which have occurred on the server. This includes, among others, system logins, password changes, and issued sudo commands.

Auth logs are an invaluable tool for monitoring and analyzing the security of your Linux server. They can indicate brute force login attacks, unauthorized access attempts, and any suspicious behavior. Regular analysis of these logs is a fundamental task in ensuring server security and data integrity.

Here is an example of how you can use the tail command to view the last few entries of the authentication log:

tail /var/log/auth.log

Services Running
Linux servers are popular for their stability and flexibility, factors that make them a preferred choice for businesses and organizations when it comes to managing various services. Services that run under a Linux server can range from web services to database services, DNS servers, mail servers, and many others.

As a Linux system administrator, it’s important to periodically review these running services to manage resources, check their statuses, and troubleshoot issues, ensuring the health and performance of the server.

Linux has a variety of tools to achieve this, such as: systemctl, service, netstat, ss and lsof.

For example, the command systemctl is widely used on Linux systems to list all running services:

systemctl --type=service 
This command will show a list of all active services along with their current status. It is a necessity for server management and should be part of any Linux system administrator’s toolbox.


Evaluating Available Memory
When running several applications in a Linux environment, constant tracking of system health is crucial for smooth operations.
Evaluating available memory as part of a server review is a common practice for system administrators. 
This involves using various command-line tools provided by Linux, such as free, vmstat, and top. 
These can assist in monitoring memory usage and performance metrics, ensuring systems are not overloaded, and adequate resources are available for important applications.


The free command, for instance, gives a summary of the overall memory usage including total used and free memory, swap memory and buffer/cache memory. Here’s an example:

$ free -h
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           15Gi       10Gi       256Mi       690Mi       5.3Gi       4.2Gi
Swap:         8.0Gi       1.3Gi       6.7Gi
