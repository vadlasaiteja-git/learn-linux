Booting Linux refers to the process that the Linux operating system undergoes when a computer system is powered on. When you switch on your device, the system bootloader is loaded into the main memory from a fixed location to start the main operating system.

The whole process involves several stages including POST (Power-On Self Test), MBR (Master Boot Record), GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader), Kernel, Init process, and finally the GUI or command line interface where users interact.

During this process, vital system checks are executed, hardware is detected, appropriate drivers are loaded, filesystems are mounted, necessary system processes are started, and finally, the user is presented with a login prompt.

Here is an example of the GRUB configuration file /etc/default/grub which is used to configure the GRUB bootloader options:

GRUB_DEFAULT=0
GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""

This is a basic introduction to booting Linux. However, the specifics may vary depending on the Linux distribution and the specific configurations of your system.

Introduction to Logs

Linux, much like other operating systems, maintains logs to help administrators understand what is happening on the system. These logs document everything, including users' activities, system errors, and kernel messages. A particularly important time for insightful log messages is during the system boot process, when key system components are loaded and initialized.

Linux utilizes various log message levels from emerg (the system is unusable) to debug (debug-level messages). During the boot process, messages from various components of the system like kernel, init, services, etc., are stored. Many Linux distributions use systemd logging system, journalctl, which holds the logs of the boot process.

Viewing boot messages can occur in real-time with the dmesg command. It's used to read and print the kernel ring buffer. Or they can be accessed via the logging setup of your system, which often includes text files in /var/log.

dmesg | less
This command presents the boot logs in a less direct format with the ability to scroll up and down. The kernel ring buffer only has a certain size, so old messages will be discarded after some time.
