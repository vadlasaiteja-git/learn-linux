Booting Linux refers to the process that the Linux operating system undergoes when a computer system is powered on. When you switch on your device, the system bootloader is loaded into the main memory from a fixed location to start the main operating system.

The whole process involves several stages including POST (Power-On Self Test), MBR (Master Boot Record), GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader), Kernel, Init process, and finally the GUI or command line interface where users interact.
